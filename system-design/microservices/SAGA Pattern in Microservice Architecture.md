Hello friends, if you are working a Java Microservice or preparing for a Java developer interview where Microservice skills are needed then you must prepare about SAGA Pattern. SAGA is an essential Microservice pattern which aims to solve the problem of long lived transaction in Microservice architecture. It’s also one of the popular Microservice Interview Question which often asked to experienced developers.

Since Microservice architecture breaks your application into multiple small applications, a single request is also broken down into multiple request and there is a chance that some part of requests are succeed and some parts are failed, in that case, maintaining data consistency is hard.

If are you dealing with real data like placing an order on Amazon then you must handle this scenario gracefully so that if payment is failed then inventory revert back to original state as well as order is not shipped.

In this article, I will explain What is SAGA Pattern? What it does, which problem it solves as well as pros and cons of SAGA Pattern in a Microservice architecture.

What is SAGA Design Pattern? What problem does it solve?
The SAGA (or Saga) pattern is a Microservice design pattern for managing data consistency in distributed systems. It provides a way to handle long-lived transactions that are composed of multiple steps, where each step is a separate database operation.

The main idea is to capture all the steps of the transaction in a database, so that in case of failure, the system can roll back the transaction to its initial state.

The SAGA pattern solves the problem of maintaining data consistency in a distributed system, where it is difficult to guarantee that all operations in a transaction are executed atomically, especially in case of failures.

One of the popular example of the SAGA pattern is an e-commerce transaction like placing an order of Amazon or FlipKart, where an order is placed, payment is deducted from the customer’s account, and items are reserved in the inventory.

If any of these steps fail, the previous steps are rolled back to ensure consistency. For instance, if the payment fails, the reservation of items is cancelled. SAGA pattern solves the problem of maintaining consistency in a transaction involving multiple steps that may or may not succeed.

Here is another Microservice architecture diagram to demonstrate how SAGA Pattern works:

Pros and Cons of SAGA Design Pattern in Microservices Architecture
Whenever we learn a pattern, we should learn its pros and cons as it help you to understand pattern better and also help you to decide when to use them in your application:

Here are some advantages and disadvantages of SAGA pattern in Microservice:

Advantages:
Here are some advantages of using SAGA Design patter in Microservice architecture:

It’s easy to implement complex transactions across multiple microservices.
Handles failures gracefully and ensures data consistency.
Increases system resilience and robustness.
Avoids data inconsistencies and lost updates.
Provides a clear and well-defined process for compensating transactions.
Disadvantages
Here are some disadvantage of using SAGA Design patter in Microservice architecture:

It’s hard to implement and maintain, its also difficult to monitor and debug
You will have overhead of storing and managing the state of sagas.
It also comes with Performance overhead due to the need to manage transactions across multiple microservices.
Your application will also suffer with Increased latency due to the need for multiple round trips between microservices.
There is no standardization in implementing sagas across different microservices. Would be better if frameworks like Spring Cloud or Quarks natively support this pattern in future.
How to Implement SAGA pattern in a Microservice Architecture?
The SAGA pattern can be implemented in a Microservices architecture by breaking down a complex business transaction into multiple, smaller, independent steps or services.

Each step would communicate with its corresponding Microservice to complete a part of the transaction. If any step fails, the system will initiate a compensating transaction to undo the previous steps.

The coordination of these steps can be achieved by using a database, message queue, or a coordination service to store the state of the transaction and to trigger compensating transactions. This way, the system can ensure eventual consistency and handle failures gracefully.

If you are wondering whether any Java Microservice framework which can provide support for SAGA Pattern? Then unfortunatley there is no specific Microservice framework that provides direct support for SAGA pattern.

Though, you can implement SAGA Pattern using libraries and frameworks such as Apache Camel or spring integration along with technologies like Apache Kafka, event sourcing, and message-driven architecture.
